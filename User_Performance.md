#### Insights and Trends

1. **User Growth and Retention**:

3. **Age Distribution**:
   - The significant engagement of younger users (20-25 and 25-30) suggests that marketing and service efforts are well-received by this demographic. However, there is a drop in engagement as age increases, which might indicate the need for targeted strategies to retain older users.

   - Implement loyalty programs, personalized offers, and improve customer service to reduce churn rates.
   - Conduct surveys to understand the reasons for customer attrition, especially focusing on the higher male attrition rate.

2. **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**:
   - Develop campaigns specifically targeting older demographics (30+ age groups) to increase their engagement and retention.
   - Utilize social media and digital platforms popular with younger audiences to maintain and enhance engagement in the 20-30 age groups.

3. **Leverage User Feedback**:
   - Analyze the 148K ratings to identify common themes in user satisfaction and dissatisfaction. 
   - Implement changes based on feedback to improve user experience and service quality.

4. **Gender-Specific Strategies**:
